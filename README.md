Shiny Project for Developing Data Products JHU

The objective of this project is to create a simple Shiny App.

I created an app that estimates calories burned based on the number of steps taken.
This app uses a very simple formula: stepCount/2000*100.
The average number of steps in a mile is 2,000 and the average number of calories
burned while walking a mile is 100.

To use the app, you simply need to input a number of steps and hit the "Submit" button.
The output will be the estimate of calories burned after taking that many steps.
